# Introduction

BuyMeACoffee has webhooks to signal events happening on a person's/org's BuyMeACoffee page. This repo just takes those signal events and saves them to Supabase.

:construction: This is a Work In Progress. But essentially the goal is to have this as a deployable web service to capture online payments and signal an online service of its status.
